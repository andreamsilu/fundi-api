## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**
   - Ensure your Laravel server is running
   - Check if the port is correct (default: 8000)
   - Verify the base URL is correct

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure users are being created successfully
   - Check if tokens are being extracted properly
   - Verify Sanctum is configured correctly

3. **Permission Errors**
   - Ensure roles and permissions are set up
   - Check if middleware is working correctly
   - Verify user roles are assigned properly

4. **Database Errors**
   - Ensure migrations are run
   - Check if database is accessible
   - Verify foreign key constraints

### Debug Mode

To see detailed responses for failed tests, you can modify the scripts to print the full response:

```bash
# Add this line after each curl command to see full response
echo "Full response: $response"
```

## Customization

### Adding New Tests

To add new tests to the scripts:

1. Add a new test section with a descriptive header
2. Make the API request using curl
3. Check the response for success indicators
4. Call `print_result` with appropriate parameters

### Modifying Test Data

You can modify the test data by changing the JSON payloads in the curl commands:

```bash
# Example: Change job title
-d "{\"title\":\"Your Custom Job Title\",\"description\":\"...\",...}"
```

### Testing Different Environments

The scripts support different environments by passing the base URL as a parameter:

```bash
# Development
./test_mobile_app.sh http://localhost:8000/api/v1

# Staging
./test_mobile_app.sh https://staging-api.fundiapp.com/v1

# Production
./test_mobile_app.sh https://api.fundiapp.com/v1
```

## Integration with CI/CD

These scripts can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Test Mobile App API
  run: |
    chmod +x test_mobile_app.sh
    ./test_mobile_app.sh ${{ env.API_BASE_URL }}
```
