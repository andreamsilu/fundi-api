9. Technical Notes
Authentication: Laravel Sanctum, role-based access


File Storage: AWS S3 / Firebase Storage with signed URLs


Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging


Payments: Pesapal for fees & subscriptions


Budget Handling: budget_breakdown JSON in job applications, total_budget calculated server-side


Monitoring: Admin can view logs, transactions, sessions, performance metrics, Laravel logs


Security: bcrypt passwords, token expiry, audit logs, multi-device session tracking, rate limiting



âœ… Conclusion:
 This unified documentation now fully supports:
Admin control across all modules


Detailed budget proposals per job with total calculation


Customer visibility of all fundi proposals


System monitoring including Laravel logs


All mobile, admin, payment, notification, and monitoring endpoints


Secure, production-ready architecture



I can next update the ERD visually to show:
budget_breakdown in job_applications


Admin control relations across all modules


Laravel log tracking


Do you want me to generate that ERD diagram?
